These are the areas that I'm currently interested in:

* **OAuth 2.0**: While was working at [IIC2233 Advanced Programming](https://github.com/IIC2233) I had to write a Flask app that included a "GitHub login" button. It was hard to me to understand the OAuth 2.0 flow, so I created a new app to explain it to me while reading the official framework.
* **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: I'm really interested in Machine Learning, but I'm trying to understand the details and code implementations that exist, so I decided to read about this. Maybe I'll post about it in the future.

These are some of the things I've work on recently:

* [**Syllabot - A bot that helps Advanced Programming TAs**](https://github.com/IIC2233): When I was a TA in IIC2233 Advanced Programming I began to work in a Telegram bot that allowed us to retrieve GitHub events and information through commands. It worked great! So now Syllabot is evolving to become **Syllabrain**.

* [**How to create a Flask + Gunicorn app in OpenShift**](https://github.com/aaossa/openshift-diy-python-how-to): I had some problems trying to automatize the configuration process of an OpenShift server, so I wrote a tutorial, wrote a simple app and created a repository explaining this process. Even the commit history follows this process! This tutorial should be useful to work with any language and framework (supported by OpenShift).

* [**OAuth 2.0 explained**](https://github.com/aaossa/OAuth2-explained): This is a complex framework, and I learn by doing, so I created this repository to explain it using Python. I'm reading the official documentation (is long) so I'm coding it really slowly.

* [**Computer Security problems**](https://github.com/aaossa/Computer-Security-Algorithms): There's a website where I've learn a lot, [id0-rsa.pub](https://id0-rsa.pub/), where to solve the problems you must study an algorithm, read a paper, and/or program a lot. I love this. I recommend this page!
