I've partipated in a couple of investigations, with **computer engineering and operations research** teachers. Also, I've been teaching assistant of some courses:

* **MAT1630 Calculus III** Assistant in Maple Labs (First semester, 2015)
* **IIC1103 Introduction to Computer Programming** This course uses Python. I was TA in Labs and grader (2014 + first semester, 2015)
* **IIC2233 Advanced Programming** This is one of the most important courses to Software Engineering, TI or Computer Sciene degree. The main programming language is Python, but we also use Git a lot. After a year in this course, I'm currently a head teaching assistant (2015 + 2016)
