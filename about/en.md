Hi, my name is **Antonio Ossa**. I'm a **Software Engineering student** at [*Pontifical Catholic University of Chile*](http://www.uc.cl/en). I'm also interested AI (Artificial Intelligence) research and pursuing a Master's degree. This is part of my story.

Since my first year at university I'm interested in **teaching and research**. I've participated in a couple of research projects with [Operations Research](http://www.ing.uc.cl/industrial-y-sistemas/) and [Computer Science](http://www.ing.uc.cl/ciencia-de-la-computacion/) teachers. Also, I've been a teaching assistant (TA) of 3 courses, where I've learnt to be a better student, TA and person:

* **IIC1103 Introduction to Computer Programming** (2014 and first semester, 2015)

> While I was a TA in this course I learnt more about Python and about new programming languages. **Programming became part of my daily life** and today I'm very comfortable programming in Python.

* **MAT1630 Calculus III** (First semester, 2015)

> I coursed Calculus III the semester after I coursed Introduction to Computer Programming. Given that I was comfortable programming in Python, I was able to display graphics and functions in 3D (using libraries like *matplotlib*) to **improve my geometric intuition**.

* **IIC2233 Advanced Programming** (2015 and 2016)

> In these two years I met people like me, who knew a lot about different things. Some of them were interested in the Go programming language, some in mobile apps development, some in *Data Mining*... **This course and the people I met led me to learn more**. I started using GitHub and visiting Hacker News. I'm also learning about Machine Learning and Data Mining, and I've learn Git. I like this.

### What's next for me?

* Learn more about **Machine Learning**, especifically about Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs),
* implement a **simple module** based in what I'm learning,
* participate in a **research project** related with ML, as a **researcher**
