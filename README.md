Welcome to the repository of my personal webpage. This is my first time using [**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Using [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome)

> **WARNING:** To use locally, in the file `_config.yml`, should use `highlighter: rouge`. But as GitHub recomended (in their "warning email") highlighter has to be `pygments`. To fix this, it seems that `pygments` Python module has to be installed in a Python 2 (2.7) version.
