## Hyde

This blog was made using [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). From their README:

> Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

Give it a try! You can use the first commit of the current branch as your template (just run `bundle exec jekyll serve`).
